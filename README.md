# Mercado Online Ph

## Description
Web app idea (work in progress!) for local Filipino markets.
Made with react.js and Firebase

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (includes npm)
- **Firebase CLI**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SaikouPat18/mercado-online-ph-web-app.git
    cd mercado-online-ph-web-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Set Up Firebase:**

    Create a Firebase project and set up Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
  
    Obtain your Firebase configuration object from the Firebase Console.

4. **Create a `.env` File:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase configuration:

    ```env
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    ```

5. **Run the Application:**

    Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    This will start the application, and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

6. **Build the Application:**

    To create a production build of your application, run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

    This will create a `build` directory with your production-ready files.

7. **Run Tests:**

    To run tests, use:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```
